ALIF: AIM API
The AIM API provides access for external applications to key routines used within the AIM. server. This page provides a reference to the available methods.

×
 Note
The API is documented as an HTML file and is found by going to the following address:
http://<IPADDRESS>/api where <IPADDRESS> is the IP address of the AIM Manager.

A windows application called the AIM Controller is available for download, whose purpose is to demo and show you the API working in action. An example C# API class has been written and published on Github. It is free to download, but comes with no support or warranty,

Best Practices
Do not login and generate a new token for every API request. When you first connect to the AIM, login and store a copy of the token that you are given, and use it for future requests. Each token that you request, creates a stored session within the AIM Manager. The duration of the session is defined by the AIM's Admin timeout that is set on the web interface under Dashboard -> Settings -> General. Creating a new token on every request will result in hundreds if not thousands of stored sessions, each taking a small amount of space on the AIM's SSD drive. If a particularly long session duration is set, for example 3 years then this could easily fill the drive over time since they don't get deleted until they expire.
Do not keep the HTTP port open. When making a request, simply send the api command, wait for the response and then close the connection. A typical web browser will fetch the html page and its associated files such as images, javascripts and ccs files and then close the connection. The AIM runs a standard Apache web service. There is no guarantee that the HTTP connection that you initially establish will always remain open.
The API is restful based, this means that you have to periodically request information from the AIM and compare the previous and latest responses to see what has changed. Be careful not to continuously send API requests as they consume resources on the AIM. Requesting the Devices, Channels, Presets and C-USB information every 5-10 seconds should usually suffice to monitor changes.
Session tokens are linked to the IP address of the host that connected to the AIM. If you change the IP address of the host and use the same token then the API will throw an error telling you that there is a mis-match.
On the AIM Controller API demo the procedure below has been used when sending API requests. This ensures that you are working with a valid token, assuming your login credentials are correct. The initial API request does not send a token, however the procedure takes care of that.
 

Example Connection Procedure
Establish the HTTP connection.
Send the API request (with the stored token, if known)
Read the response.
If the response is a Login error then
Send a login request with the appropriate username and password.
Read the response.
If the login request is successful, extract and store the new token.
Go back to step 2 and resend the original API request with the stored token.
If the login request fails, then handle appropriately.
If the response is different error then handle it appropriately.
Close the HTTP connection.
Process the response.
Repeat above procedure for the next API command.

Using a Web Browser to test the API
You can use a web browser to issue test API commands to the AIM Manager, however, when you authenticate and receive a token, a web session is also created between the browser and AIM. If you try to use the same web browser to also access the AIM's admin web interface, a different session will be created. This can cause the API token to become invalid on the browser. To resolve this, it is recommended that you use two different web browsers, for example, Google Chrome for the API and FireFox for the AIM's admin web interface. This will allow two different sessions to operate simultaneously. This only affects web browsers.

login
This method was last updated in API version 1, and is compatible with API requests from version 1 onwards
The API will require a valid AIM user's login credentials to be presented in
the first request. The API will return an authentication code, which must be
passed in all future requests. This authentication code can be re-used until
a logout request is made, at which point the authentication code will no
longer be valid.
The concept of an 'anonymous user' can apply to the API. If no login username
and password are provided, the API will return an authentication token for
the anonymous user (either the same one as for the OSD, or else an 'anonymous
API user' account can be created).

Input parameters:
- username
- password
- v (the AIM API version this request is designed for)

Output values:
- timestamp - the current server time
- version - the current API version number
- token - an authentication code for future API requests
- success
